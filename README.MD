## ABOUT THE REPOSITORY.
This repository contains games in a language that was not intended for game design and with a library that was not intended for that purpose either. This serves to demonstrate the magic of programming and that the limit is set by us, those of us behind a screen creating and evolving, learning and improving ourselves.

# GAMES:


## SNAKE
![](https://github.com/DamianPyCoder/PythonTurtle__Game_x2__Snake_Tenis/blob/main/SNAKE/snake2.png)

#### WHAT'S THE GAME ABOUT.
The tarjet of this game is to eat the small turtles that appear randomly on the screen one by one, without touching the limits or itself. The difficulty lies in the fact that each turtle that it feeds on makes its body grow and as the seconds pass, the difficulty to move within the screen will become apparent.
